## About

DFBehaviors is a collection of usable Behaviors. Inspiried by my friend Krzysztof Zab≈Çocki. His article about Behaviors can be found here: http://www.objc.io/issue-13/behaviors.html

## How this works?

You simply drop NSObject to XIB, change its class to some of Behavior, and connect all needed IBOutlets and/or change settings in interface builder with IBInspectable properties. All behaviors inhertis from UIControl, so you can also observe value change notifications. Both solutions are shown in examples.

## Will be implemented soon

DFTableViewDataSourceBehavior
DFCollectionViewDataSourceBehavior
DFSoundPlayerBehavior

## Installation

DFBehaviors is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:
